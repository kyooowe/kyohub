This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## PostgreSQL data

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` to a PostgreSQL connection string. The password, grocery, and baby-needs features use the same shared database workspace; their server actions provide create, read, update, and delete operations. The password manager reads only from PostgreSQL. Existing browser-saved grocery and baby-needs items are imported into PostgreSQL the first time each browser opens the corresponding feature.

After changing `prisma/schema.prisma`, run `npm run contract:emit` to regenerate the typed contract, then `npx prisma db init` to apply additive schema changes.

This workspace currently has no sign-in or access control, so anyone who can reach the app can read and change the shared data. Password entries are stored as plaintext in PostgreSQL. Do not expose this app publicly until authentication, authorization, and password encryption are added.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
